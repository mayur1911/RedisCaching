SQL Concepts and Definitions with Use Cases

1. Stored Procedures:
Definition: A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. 
It is stored in the database and can accept parameters, perform operations, and return results.
Use Case: In the provided script, sp_GetManagerById is a stored procedure used to retrieve a manager's details by their ID.

2. SELECT Statement:
Definition: The SELECT statement is used to query data from one or more tables in a database.
Use Case: In the sp_GetManagerById procedure, the SELECT statement retrieves the ManagerID, ManagerName, ManagerDesignation, and ProjectName from the Manager table.

3. NOLOCK Hint:
Definition: The NOLOCK hint allows a SELECT statement to read data without acquiring shared locks, potentially reading uncommitted data.
Use Case: The NOLOCK hint is used in the SELECT query within both stored procedures to read the Manager table without locking the rows.

4. IF-ELSE Logic:
Definition: The IF-ELSE statement is used to execute different blocks of SQL code depending on whether a specified condition is true or false.
Use Case: In sp_AddOrUpdateManager, IF-ELSE logic is used to determine whether to update an existing manager or insert a new one.

5. OUTPUT Parameter:
Definition: OUTPUT parameters are used in stored procedures to return values to the calling program or query.
Use Case: The sp_AddOrUpdateManager procedure uses the OUTPUT parameter (@newId) to return the ManagerID, whether it's an updated or newly inserted value.

6. SCOPE_IDENTITY():
Definition: SCOPE_IDENTITY() returns the last identity value generated for a specific session and scope.
Use Case: In sp_AddOrUpdateManager, SCOPE_IDENTITY() is used to return the ID of the newly inserted manager after an INSERT operation.

**`@@IDENTITY`**  
*Definition:*  
- `@@IDENTITY` returns the last identity value generated for the current session, regardless of the scope.

*Use Case:*  
- `@@IDENTITY` can be used to retrieve the identity value generated by an `INSERT` operation, even if it occurs within a trigger or another scope.

*Example:*  
- If a trigger on the `Manager` table inserts a record into another table with an identity column, `@@IDENTITY` will return the identity value from that trigger,
not the `Manager` table itself. This can lead to unexpected results if triggers are involved, which is why `SCOPE_IDENTITY()` is preferred in many cases.

7. UPDATE Statement:
Definition: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table.
Use Case: In sp_AddOrUpdateManager, the UPDATE statement is used to modify the details of an existing manager.

8. INSERT INTO:
Definition: The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new records to a table.
Use Case: In sp_AddOrUpdateManager, the INSERT INTO statement is used to insert a new manager's details into the Manager table.

9. SET NOCOUNT OFF:
Definition: SET NOCOUNT ON/OFF determines whether the number of rows affected by a SQL statement is returned as part of the result set.
Use Case: SET NOCOUNT OFF is used in the sp_AddOrUpdateManager procedure to enable the row count message, which can be useful for debugging and understanding the number of affected rows.

10. Parameterized Queries:
Definition: Parameterized queries allow values to be passed as arguments to SQL statements, preventing SQL injection and improving code readability.
Use Case: Both procedures use parameters like @ManagerID, @ManagerName, etc., to perform dynamic operations based on the input values.

11. **`VARCHAR` vs `NVARCHAR`**  
*Definition:*  
- `VARCHAR` (Variable Character) is used to store non-Unicode characters, meaning it supports only ASCII characters.
- `NVARCHAR` (National Variable Character) is used to store Unicode characters, supporting characters from multiple languages.

*Use Case:*  
- Use `VARCHAR` for data that only contains English or standard ASCII characters (e.g., usernames or passwords).
- Use `NVARCHAR` when data involves multiple languages or special characters (e.g., storing names in different scripts such as Chinese, Arabic, etc.).

*Example:*  
- **VARCHAR:** Storing an English name like `JohnDoe` in `VARCHAR(50)` will use fewer bytes (1 byte per character).
- **NVARCHAR:** Storing a name in Chinese characters like `李小龍` in `NVARCHAR(50)` will store each character using 2 bytes, allowing multiple languages to be stored in the same field.

**12. GO Statement:**  
*Definition:*  
- `GO` is a batch terminator used in SQL Server to indicate the end of a batch of T-SQL statements. It is not a T-SQL command but a signal to the SQL Server tools to execute the preceding batch of statements as a unit.

*Use Case:*  
- In both `sp_AddOrUpdateManager` and `sp_GetManagerById`, the `GO` statement is used after the creation of the stored procedures to mark the end of the batch, ensuring that SQL Server processes each procedure creation separately from other operations.

13. SQL Function: A function in SQL returns a single value or a table and is used in SELECT statements. It must return a value and cannot modify database data directly (e.g., no INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE).

14 SQL Stored Procedure: A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can perform complex operations, including modifying data (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). It may or may not return a value and can include input/output parameters.

*Functions are typically used for calculations and returning data, while stored procedures are more flexible and used for broader tasks.*
